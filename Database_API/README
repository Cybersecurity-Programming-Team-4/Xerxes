The project will use a MySQL database hosted on Google Cloud Platform and using Cloud SQL
Create Google Cloud account.
From there, navigate to the Xerxes project console and go to the Cloud SQL dashboard.

Fill out the fields and keep track of the <Master Username> and <Master Password>, they will be needed to access the DB later.
Once filled, launch and wait a couple of minutes for the DB to be created.

Then, click on the instance and edit it to append your address to the network list.
GCP is configured where the app can access it directly, but for initial configuration and testing, we will need to whitelist ourselves.

Then you will have to open port 3306, and the method will vary based on your OS.
Do that, and in the meantime download MySQL Workbench: https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/

Finally add a connection/management for the Cloud SQL DB in MySQL Workbench.

Hostname = The Instance's Endpoint
Username = Master Username
Password = Master Password

Then you can configure the instance just like a local DB. (Add tables, columns, data, other configuration, etc.)

For the Python code, it will be Python 3 and the library being used for DB work is PyMySQL, imported as pymysql, which you will have to install.
