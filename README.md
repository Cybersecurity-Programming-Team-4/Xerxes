# Xerxes: An autonomous scanner, analyzer, and data repository.


Xerxes is a cybersecurity project made for the purpose of the reconnaisance and scanning stages of the Ethical Hacking Process with a small directed focus towards WordPress sites due to their popularity. All information gathered is freely shared and methods used are non-intrusive. 

# Xerxes' "arms" are :
[MASSCAN](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) by Robert Graham for service enumeration.
[WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) by the WPScan Team to assess a site for WordPress elements.

Information gathered from these tools are then processed and stored within the instance housing Xerxes and can be queried by users.

Querying occurs from Xerxes' face, a sleek website acting as a front end to this project.
