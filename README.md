# Xerxes: An autonomous vulnerability scanner and analyzer and data repository.

Xerxes is a cybersecurity project made for the purpose of the reconnaisance and scanning stages of the Ethical Hacking Process with a small directed focus towards WordPress sites due to their popularity. All information gathered is freely shared and methods used are non-intrusive. 

Xerxes' "arms" are MASSCAN by Robert Graham for service enumeration and WPScan by the WPScan Team to assess a site for WordPress elements.
Information gathered from these tools are then processed and stored within the instance housing Xerxes and can be queried by users.
